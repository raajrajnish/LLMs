# Building Systems with the ChatGPT API

An introduction on building systems using the ChatGPT API. We will learn best practices for building a complex application using an LLM. 

## What we will build
We will be building an end-to-end customer service assistant system that chains multiple calls to a language model, using different instructions 
depending on the output of the previous call, and sometimes even looking things up from external sources.
